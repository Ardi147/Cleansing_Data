x = 10

y = 5

result = x > y

print(result)

print(type(result))

• numeric

# • qualitative
# • quantitative
# • structured

# 2. Data Manipulation
# 2.1 Import, store, and export data 
# Fundamental understanding of ETL:
# • extract
# • transform
# • load
# • common data storage file formats (delimited data files, XML, JSON)
# 2.2 Clean data
# Purpose and common practices:
# • handling NULL
# • special characters
# • trimming spaces
# • inconsistent formatting
# • removing duplicates 
# • imputing data
# • validating data
# 2.3 Organize data
# Purpose and common practices:
# • sorting
# • filtering
# • slicing
# • transposing 
# • appending
# • truncating
# 2.4 Aggregate data
# Purpose and common practices:
# • grouping
# • joining/merging 
# • summarizing
# • pivoting
